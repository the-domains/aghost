After
many months of planning and setting things up, our Halloween event on the
U.S.S. Turner Joy is finally over. Scott and Daniel had done just about EVERYTHING, it was
amazing what they accomplished.

Jennifer helped get everyone in line, got all the props and makeup, just did an amazing job too. So blessed to have wonderful friends like them and especially have them in our group. I don't know what I would do without them.

Anyway, things were a little rocky like finding volunteers that would actually commit and with the volunteers that were there, had to make sure they were safe and would stay.  But it is done, thank god, I feel like I am still recovering from it.
