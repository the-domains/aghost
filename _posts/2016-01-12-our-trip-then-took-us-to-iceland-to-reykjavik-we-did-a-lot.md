In September we had such a whirlwind trip. Ross, Jon and I (June) first started off our paranormal journey going to St. Augustine to the legendary light house. Before the regular public ghost hunt started, we were treated to a private ghost hunt and tour. It is such an amazing place with so much incredible history. We did not get any tangible evidence but we did have some interesting personal experiences.
