            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Our trip then took us to Iceland to Reykjavik, we did a lot more touristy things there but stayed in an old school house that is now an Inn, very cute place, basic beds and shared bathroom. We did manage to go toone of the oldestcemeteries:</h1><p>In September we had such a whirlwind trip. Ross, Jon and I (June) first started off our paranormal journey going to St. Augustine to the legendary light house. Before the regular public ghost hunt started, we were treated to a private ghost hunt and tour. It is such an amazing place with so much incredible history. We did not get any tangible evidence but we did have some interesting personal experiences.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/324793e94f1a8b3028de897b0f45c2c267ce3b22.webp"></article>]]></description>
